# Convert Bot

> A single-file, super-light “butter-bot” that converts any number between the most common temperature, weight, and length units—instantly, right in the browser.

&nbsp;

| Unit group | Conversions (both directions) |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Temperature | °C ↔ °F |
| Weight | oz ↔ g • lb ↔ kg |
| Length | in ↔ cm • m ↔ ft |

The app is framework-free, loads in under 1 kB of JS, and ships with a dark aesthetic + Gervi-branded header/footer (matching [disagree.btrbot.com](https://disagree.btrbot.com)).
